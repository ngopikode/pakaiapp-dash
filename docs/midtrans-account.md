<br />

> 📘 Note
>
> * `Client Key`: Used as API key to be used for authorization on **frontend** API request/configuration. So it safe to put in your HTML / client code publicly.
> * `Server Key`: Used as API key to be used for authorization while calling Midtrans API from **backend**. So **keep it confidential**.

<br />

You can use the Sandbox environment during your development phase of integrating Midtrans’ payment system. You can also test dummy transactions on the Sandbox environment.

<br />

<br />

* **Sandbox Environment**: Can be used to create "testing" transactions (usually performed from your development/testing environment). All transaction made within this environment mode is not "real", and does not require "real payment/fund". You can simulate a test-payment [via Sandbox Simulator](/docs/testing-payment-on-sandbox) to change the payment status, as if it has been paid. This environment is created automatically when you are signing up, and free to use.

<br />

* **Production Environment**: Can be used when you are ready to accept "real payment/fund" from your customer. Customer will need to make a real payment to trigger the payment status update. Transaction fee may apply to any payment created in this environment mode.

<br />

API Keys between **Production & Sandbox** environment are different. Please make sure to access correct dashboard environment.

Transaction data are separated between each environments, so it will not interfere/get mixed with each other. Settings & configurations are mostly separated between each environments, so you can have two different settings for testing and production mode.

Once your account is locked, it will be automatically unlocked after 15 minutes.

If you are not able to unlock your account after 15 minutes, please inform [support@midtrans.com](mailto:support@midtrans.com) to begin the unlock process. Once the account is unlocked, please log in to Midtrans MAP account using your existing password.
